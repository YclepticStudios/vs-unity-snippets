# VS Unity Snippets
This collection of Visual Studio snippets is created for working with Unity
C# scripts. It contains the "Message" functions within MonoBehaviour, such as "Start",
"OnCollisionEnter", and "OnSerializeNetworkView", complete with their signatures and
brief documentation.

## Usage
To use the snippets, simply begin typing one of the functions and the suggestions will
appear within the IntelliSense popup. Press tab twice to insert the snippet. All the
snippets are appended with "_Documentation" to differentiate them from the built in
Unity snippets (built in snippets do not contain documentation).

## Installation
* Open VS and select `Tools > Code Snippets Manager...` or press `Ctrl`+`K`, `Ctrl`+`B`.
* Do one of the following depending on whether you want to link to this folder or copy
   the snippets into VS internal snippets folder.
  * Choose `Add...` and select the `snippets` folder to link to these snippets.
  * Choose `Import...` and select all the `xxx.snippets` files in the `snippets` folder to
   copy the files into VS internal snippets folder.
